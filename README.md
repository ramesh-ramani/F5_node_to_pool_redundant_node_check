# F5_node_to_pool_redundant_node_check.py

This script will intake the Nodes the user specifies and check if there are Redundant Nodes in the Pool that the Nodes belong to. If there are no Redundant Nodes it will print out that the specific Node's Pool does not have a Redundant Node and you can use that information to ensure that you do not, for example, take that Node out of the Pool for servicing that Node(server)
